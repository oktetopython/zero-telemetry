# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing the misleading error messages and improving the patch application process in the AugmentCode-Free application. The current issue is that the patch system reports "恢复原始文件失败!" (restore original file failed) even when operations are actually successful.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want accurate error messages during patch operations, so that I can understand what actually happened.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a patch operation succeeds THEN the system SHALL display success messages only
2. WHEN a patch operation fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error details
3. WHEN a file restore operation succeeds THEN the system SHALL NOT display failure messages
4. WHEN error handling occurs THEN the system SHALL log the actual exception details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the patch system to handle already-patched files gracefully, so that I don't get confusing error messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is already patched THEN the system SHALL detect this correctly
2. WHEN attempting to patch an already-patched file THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback
3. WHEN patch detection fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback detection methods
4. WHEN multiple patch attempts occur THEN the system SHALL handle them consistently

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want detailed logging during patch operations, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN patch operations run THEN the system SHALL log each step clearly
2. WHEN exceptions occur THEN the system SHALL log the specific exception type and message
3. WHEN file operations happen THEN the system SHALL log file sizes and timestamps
4. WHEN backup operations occur THEN the system SHALL verify backup integrity

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved error handling in the patch system, so that the application is more reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exceptions are caught THEN they SHALL be logged with full details
2. WHEN file operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide specific failure reasons
3. WHEN backup restoration occurs THEN the system SHALL verify the operation success
4. WHEN patch validation happens THEN the system SHALL use multiple detection methods
