# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Enhance exception handling in patch application


  - Replace generic `except:` blocks with specific exception types
  - Add detailed logging for each exception type with full error details
  - Create specific error messages for different failure scenarios
  - Log the actual exception type and message instead of generic failures
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 2. Implement backup and restore verification


  - Create `_verify_backup_integrity` method to check backup file creation
  - Create `_verify_restore_success` method to verify restore operations
  - Add file size and timestamp comparisons for verification
  - Implement safe restore with rollback capability if verification fails
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.3, 4.3_

- [x] 3. Improve patch detection accuracy


  - Enhance `_is_already_patched` method with multiple detection strategies
  - Add size-based detection for files that may have lost signatures
  - Implement content pattern detection as fallback method
  - Add confidence scoring for different detection methods
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 4.4_

- [x] 4. Add comprehensive operation logging


  - Create detailed logging for each step of patch operations
  - Log file states before and after operations (size, timestamp, patch status)
  - Add operation timing and performance metrics to logs
  - Implement structured logging with operation context
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4_

- [x] 5. Implement safe file operations with error recovery

  - Add file locking detection and user-friendly error messages
  - Implement temporary backup creation before risky operations
  - Add automatic cleanup of temporary files on success or failure
  - Create rollback mechanisms for failed operations
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 6. Test and validate error handling improvements



  - Test patch application with files in various states (original, patched, corrupted)
  - Test error scenarios like file locks, permission issues, and disk space
  - Verify that success messages only appear for actual successes
  - Validate that all error messages provide actionable information for users
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.4, 3.1_
