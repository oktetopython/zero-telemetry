# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Add the missing _append_log method to MainPage class

  - Ensure method has identical signature and behavior to _add_log
  - Add appropriate docstring for the new method
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1_

- [x] 2. Verify signal connections work correctly


  - Test that PatchWorker.progress_updated connects to _append_log without errors
  - Test that RestoreWorker.progress_updated connects to _append_log without errors  
  - Test that ScanWorker.progress_updated connects to _append_log without errors
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1_

- [x] 3. Test patch scanning functionality


  - Launch application and navigate to patch section
  - Click "Scan Status" button and verify no AttributeError occurs
  - Verify log messages appear correctly in the log text area
  - Confirm scan results are displayed properly
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [x] 4. Test patch application functionality  

  - Click "Apply Patch" button and verify no crashes occur
  - Verify progress updates are logged correctly during patch application
  - Confirm file discovery messages are displayed via _append_log calls
  - Test completion status logging
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 5. Test patch restoration functionality

  - Click "Restore Files" button and verify no crashes occur
  - Verify progress updates are logged correctly during restoration
  - Confirm restoration completion status is logged properly
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 6. Validate consistent logging behavior


  - Compare output from _add_log and _append_log methods to ensure identical behavior
  - Verify both methods scroll log area to bottom after adding messages
  - Test that both methods handle various message types correctly
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 4.1, 4.3_
