# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing a critical bug in the AugmentCode-Free application where the `MainPage` class is missing the `_append_log` method, causing the application to crash when users try to use patch-related functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the patch scanning functionality to work without crashing, so that I can successfully scan patch status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Scan Status" button THEN the application SHALL NOT crash with AttributeError
2. WHEN patch-related operations are performed THEN log messages SHALL be properly displayed in the log area
3. WHEN the `_append_log` method is called THEN it SHALL function identically to the existing `_add_log` method

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the patch application functionality to work without errors, so that I can apply patches to IDE extensions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Apply Patch" button THEN the application SHALL NOT crash due to missing methods
2. WHEN patch operations generate progress updates THEN they SHALL be displayed in the log area
3. WHEN patch file discovery occurs THEN the file information SHALL be logged properly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the patch restoration functionality to work correctly, so that I can restore original files when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Restore Files" button THEN the application SHALL NOT crash
2. WHEN restoration operations generate progress updates THEN they SHALL be displayed in the log area
3. WHEN restoration completes THEN the final status SHALL be properly logged

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent method naming throughout the codebase, so that the application is maintainable and bug-free.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN all log-related method calls SHALL use consistent naming
2. WHEN adding new functionality THEN it SHALL use the established logging pattern
3. WHEN the application runs THEN there SHALL be no AttributeError exceptions related to missing methods
